<h3>What to expect</h3>
<p>A casual summer reception with drinks, lunch, lawn games and dancing.<br>
Noon to 4 p.m.</p>

<h3>What to Wear</h3>
<p>Goward House is a large heritage home located in a six-acre urban woodland with a large lawn and looped paths to explore. Formal attire is not required! Feel free to dress in whatever makes you feel good. Karina will be wearing a summer dress and Simon promises to be wearing shorts.</p>

<h3>Registry</h3>
<p>We are so happy that youâ€™ll be able to join us for our wedding reception. As many of you know, we live in a small house, and it is already filled with all the things we need to make it a home. Gifts are not expected or required but for those who wish to offer a gift, we would gratefully accept donations toward our kitchen renovation fund.</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>Parking is available in the lot at Goward House and on the street.</p>
